Prutser WordPress Theme
=======================

The **Prutser** WordPress Theme is a basic theme build upon Bootstrap (v5).
It is mainly intended for personal use (for now) and serve as a base for
child themes for specific sites.

Inspiration for various bits of code is taken from:
 - `Gutenberg Starter Theme <https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg-starter-theme>`_
 - `Twenty Nineteen Theme <https://github.com/WordPress/twentynineteen>`_
 - `Understrap Theme <https://github.com/understrap/understrap>`_ (for ideas for better Bootstrap integration)
